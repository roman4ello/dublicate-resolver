This small project builds to jar.
To it:
- pull this project to your local PC or download 
- execute gradle build (or gradle jar) (before you should have gradle on your OS or IDE)
- in your project(/build/libs/) you will see dublicate-resolver-1.0.jar

How to use:

After run - you can choose one or more files with records divided by some pattern (",", "\n", ... ).
Then you will be asked of name of output file you want.
Then go and use your new file with unique records.

P.S. Regex should be the same in each files.
